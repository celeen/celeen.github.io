    <p>In the beginning I honestly didn’t think of learning code as a career move. I just wanted to build the things I was designing. But it is obvious that having this knowledge is a huge plus, especially if you are working (or want to work) at a startup or tech company. Also, if you are doing client work on your own, you won’t always need to outsource the development work if you can do it yourself. I was feeling stagnant in my design career when I started dabbling with code. It opened up a new dimension for me to grow as a designer. Now the learning path is pretty much endless.</p>
